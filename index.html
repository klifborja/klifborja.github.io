    <p>Data analysis has been an essential part of my 19 years in coffee.
        <li>In Sales Management we used data on company sales reports to identify the top selling vs slow moving items
            in our inventory. This helped us trim our slow moving inventory by 40% by closing out the slow moving items
            and a 30% increase in sales for our top sellers.</li>
        <li>In Company Management we were able to analyze reports to help identify areas in the company that needed
            refinement. Our efforts led to higher efficiency in all departments</li>
        <li>Product Development relies heavily on Data to drive decision making when researching, implementing, and
            executing the launch a new product.</li>
        <li>In Quality Control, data helps identify defects, inconsistencies, and other areas that might be affecting
            the integrity of a particular product.</li>
    </p>

    <p>This is a little about who I am.</p>
